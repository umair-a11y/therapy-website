## 2) About — `/about`

### Headline
**Therapy that respects how men actually live**

Men are told to “figure it out.” You probably have—until the old ways stop working. Resolve is a focused practice for men in Ontario. We work in plain language, set realistic goals, and stick to what helps.

### Approach
We draw from **CBT**, **ACT**, **IFS**, and **SFBT** to help you:  
- Notice thoughts and body signals earlier.  
- Respond instead of react.  
- Build routines that support mood and energy.  
- Practice boundaries and better conversations.

### What working together looks like
- **Collaborative:** you’re the expert on your life; we bring structure and tools.  
- **Practice‑oriented:** small experiments between sessions build momentum.  
- **Measurable:** we check in on what’s changing and what still needs work.

### Standards

- Adheres to CRPO professional standards and privacy law.
