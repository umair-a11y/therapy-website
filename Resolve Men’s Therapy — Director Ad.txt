Resolve Men’s Therapy — Director Addendum: Best Practices, Gaps & GPT-5 Responsibilities (v1.1)

Scope: Next.js App Router (TypeScript) on Vercel. Target: men in Ontario; virtual-only care; 30-minute consult CTA; measurement-minded (Self-Assessments).
Goal: Beat First Step Men’s Therapy on clarity, engagement, and technical quality without tripping compliance.

1) Non-negotiables (what Google & W3C actually grade you on)

Core Web Vitals (field data): Optimize LCP, INP, CLS and verify in Search Console. INP replaced FID—treat responsiveness seriously. 
Google for Developers
+1

People-first content: Write for humans first; demonstrate experience, expertise, and usefulness. Use the self-assessment questions from Google’s doc to QA every page. 
Google for Developers

No intrusive popups: Use small, easily dismissible bottom-sheets for any “Take a Self-Assessment” prompts—avoid full-page interstitials that block content (mobile especially). 
Google for Developers

Metadata & share cards: Use the Next.js Metadata API per route and generate dynamic OG images for better share CTR. 
Next.js

Accessibility: Follow WCAG 2.2 (contrast, focus, semantics) and WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for components like accordions/dialogs. Automate checks in Playwright with axe-core. 
W3C

2) Common website gaps (and exact fixes in this stack)
A. Performance & CWV

Slow LCP (hero image too heavy): Use next/image with width/height, priority, and modern formats. Defer non-critical JS. Verify LCP in Lighthouse CI. 
Next.js

Poor INP (long tasks): Trim JS, split code, avoid blocking third-party scripts, use React Server Components and selective hydration. Confirm INP in Search Console. 
Google for Developers

CLS (layout jumps): Always reserve space for images/fonts. Use next/font to self-host and prevent swaps. 
Next.js
+1

Over-prefetching: Accept Next’s defaults; if needed, prefetch on intent (router.prefetch)—don’t globally prefetch huge menus. 
Next.js

B. Technical SEO

Missing/weak metadata: Implement generateMetadata() on every route (title, description, canonical, OG/Twitter). 
Next.js

Sitemap & robots: Add app/sitemap.ts and app/robots.ts with correct allows. 
Next.js

Structured data: Add Organization / ProfessionalService JSON-LD with areaServed: "Ontario, CA", plus BlogPosting and breadcrumbs. 
Schema.org

Popups harming SEO: Keep any promo dialog non-intrusive; don’t cover primary content on load. 
Google for Developers

C. Accessibility

Headings/landmarks: One H1 per page; use <main>, <nav>, <footer>. WCAG 2.2 reference for quick checks. 
W3C

Keyboard traps / dialog focus: Follow ARIA patterns for dialogs/accordions; test with Playwright + axe. 
W3C
+1

Contrast & focus visibility: Meet AA minimum; ensure focus isn’t obscured. 
W3C

D. Security & Privacy

Security headers: Add CSP (start in Report-Only), X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, etc., via Next’s headers guide / Vercel docs. 
Next.js
+1

Keep Next.js patched: Track security notes (e.g., middleware CVE) and update when advised. 
Vercel

E. Compliance (Ontario)

CRPO advertising: No client testimonials in any form (including republishing third-party reviews). 
CRPO
+1

Electronic practice: Follow CRPO electronic practice standards; obtain informed consent for virtual care tech. 
CRPO

PHIPA: Be explicit about what’s collected; Self-Assessments show on device by default; email opt-ins require clear consent. 
IPC Ontario

CASL: Every email = consent + sender identification + 1-click unsubscribe. 
CRTC

5) Conversion playbook (lightweight, research-backed)

Hero clarity: H1 says who it’s for + the outcome; subhead trims friction; singular primary CTA; others are secondary text links. 
v10.carbondesignsystem.com

Reading pattern: Front-load value and key links near the top/left to match F-pattern scanning. 
didattica.uniroma2.it

CTA copy: Use action + outcome (“Book a 30-minute consult” beats “Get started”). Keep one primary action per view. 
webcomponents.ucla.edu
+1

Prompts, not popups: Offer “Take a Self-Assessment” as a small, dismissible bottom-sheet; never block content on arrival. 
Google for Developers

6) Automation we’ll wire (repo-aware)

Playwright visual regression: home.spec.ts, services.spec.ts, assessments.spec.ts, blog.spec.ts, contact.spec.ts; viewports 1280×800 & 390×844; expect(page).toHaveScreenshot({ fullPage: true }). 
Playwright

Axe in Playwright: add @axe-core/playwright; run await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze() on key routes in CI. 
Playwright

8) “Gaps → Fixes” quick table
Gap found	Why it hurts	Fix in this stack
Hero image shifts layout	CLS fails; trust drops	next/image with explicit size + priority; preload. 
Next.js

Google for Developers

Popup covers content	Search & UX penalty	Use dismissible bottom-sheet; no full-screen interstitial. 
Google for Developers

Missing metadata/OG	Poor snippets & CTR	generateMetadata() + dynamic OG via next/og. 
Next.js

Weak a11y (dialogs)	Keyboard/screen reader blocks	Follow ARIA patterns; axe checks in CI. 
W3C

9) Housekeeping for this repo (actionable)

Consolidate Next config: keep next.config.ts only; remove next.config.js after parity check.

Ignore artifacts: ensure playwright-report/ and test-results/ are in .gitignore.

Husky hooks: pre-commit typecheck/lint/format; pre-push pnpm test:ci (Playwright + axe + Lighthouse CI link step).

10) Definitions we align to (short)

Core Web Vitals: LCP (load), INP (interactivity), CLS (stability). 
Google for Developers

People-first content: authenticity, usefulness, expertise; not “SEO-first.” 
Google for Developers

Intrusive interstitials: overlays blocking content at or soon after load—avoid. 
Google for Developers

Done right, this gives you:

Search-ready pages with strong snippets,

Fast, calm UI that respects how men actually read and act,

A safety net (visual/a11y/perf) that keeps quality from slipping,

Compliance that doesn’t dull the message.

If you want, I can now open a PR checklist tailored to your current branches and drop in the CSP, Metadata, JSON-LD, and Playwright+axe scaffolds in one shot.
