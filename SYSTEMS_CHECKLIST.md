# SYSTEMS CHECKLIST: CRPO-Integrated Development Workflow
*Formal systems checklist for Resolve Men's Therapy website development*

## üö® CRITICAL: CRPO COMPLIANCE FILTERS
**‚ö†Ô∏è These checks are MANDATORY before any content goes live. CRPO violations can result in professional discipline.**

### üî¥ PROHIBITED CONTENT (Must Never Appear)
- [ ] ‚ùå **NO TESTIMONIALS** - Client testimonials, reviews, or endorsements are strictly prohibited
- [ ] ‚ùå **NO SUPERLATIVE CLAIMS** - Avoid "best", "fastest", "top-rated", "most effective", "#1", etc.
- [ ] ‚ùå **NO OUTCOME GUARANTEES** - Cannot promise specific results or success rates
- [ ] ‚ùå **NO COMPARATIVE STATEMENTS** - Cannot claim to be better than other therapists/practices
- [ ] ‚ùå **NO UNPROVABLE CLAIMS** - All statements must be factual and verifiable
- [ ] ‚ùå **NO MISLEADING RANKINGS** - No "5-star rating", "top 3 psychotherapists", etc.

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED CONTENT (Must Always Include)
- [ ] ‚úÖ **ACCURATE QUALIFICATIONS** - Only advertise services with verifiable training
- [ ] ‚úÖ **CLEAR SERVICE DESCRIPTIONS** - Transparent about what therapy involves
- [ ] ‚úÖ **CRPO REGISTRATION STATUS** - Clearly state "CRPO Registered Psychotherapist (Qualifying)"
- [ ] ‚úÖ **PROPER DISCLAIMERS** - Include therapy limitations and emergency procedures
- [ ] ‚úÖ **TRANSPARENT ADVERTISING** - Any paid content must be clearly labeled
- [ ] ‚úÖ **EDUCATIONAL FOCUS** - Content should inform, not promote

## üíª DEVELOPMENT BEST PRACTICES (TypeScript/React/Next.js 2025)

### Code Quality Checklist

#### TypeScript Integration (2025 Standards)
- [ ] **Type Safety Excellence**
  - [ ] Zero 'any' types in new code (< 1% legacy allowance)
  - [ ] Proper interface definitions for all props, state, and API responses
  - [ ] Strict mode enabled with `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictFunctionTypes`
  - [ ] Use branded types for type safety (e.g., `UserId`, `Email`)
  - [ ] Generic constraints properly defined for reusable components

- [ ] **Advanced TypeScript Patterns**
  - [ ] Use conditional types for complex component APIs
  - [ ] Implement proper discriminated unions for state management
  - [ ] Leverage template literal types for type-safe string manipulation
  - [ ] Use `satisfies` operator for better type inference (TypeScript 4.9+)
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling with Result/Either types

#### React/Next.js Standards (2025 Best Practices)
- [ ] **React Server Components (RSC)**
  - [ ] Use RSC for data fetching and static content
  - [ ] Properly mark client components with 'use client'
  - [ ] Minimize client-side JavaScript bundle
  - [ ] Use RSC for initial page loads and navigation
  - [ ] Implement proper streaming with Suspense boundaries

- [ ] **Component Architecture**

  - [ ] Implement proper error boundaries with fallback UI
  - [ ] Use React.memo() judiciously for performance optimization
  - [ ] Leverage React.forwardRef() for component library consistency
  - [ ] Implement proper compound component patterns

- [ ] **Next.js App Router (2025)**
  - [ ] Use file-based routing with app directory structure
  - [ ] Implement proper loading.tsx and error.tsx files
  - [ ] Use layout.tsx for shared UI patterns

- [ ] **State Management Patterns**
  - [ ] Use built-in React state for component-level state
  - [ ] Implement useReducer for complex state logic
  - [ ] Leverage React Context for app-wide state (sparingly)
  - [ ] Use server state management for data fetching
  - [ ] Avoid unnecessary state management libraries

#### Performance Optimization (2025 Standards)
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals Excellence**
  - [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
  - [ ] First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms

  - [ ] Implement next/font for optimal font loading
  - [ ] Use dynamic imports for code splitting
  - [ ] Leverage Static Site Generation (SSG) where appropriate
  - [ ] Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic content

- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**
  - [ ] Analyze bundle size with @next/bundle-analyzer
  - [ ] Implement tree shaking for unused code elimination
  - [ ] Use ES modules for better tree shaking
  - [ ] Optimize third-party library imports
