Project Documentation
=====================

Structure overview:


- INDEX.md – High-level map & quick links.
- architecture/ – Information architecture & technical structure.
- guides/ – How-to guides (UI components, brand usage, etc.).
- processes/ – Repeatable workflows (content review, deployment, governance).
- checklists/ – Operational checklists (systems, deployment).
- copy/ – Canonical marketing & product copy referenced by the live site.
- archive/ – Historical drafts, prompts, analyses retained for context only.

Contribution principles:

1. Prefer updating an existing doc over creating a near-duplicate.
2. Every new doc must answer: audience, source of truth, update owner.
3. If a doc becomes obsolete, move it to archive/ with a rationale logged in archive/ARCHIVE_LOG.md.
4. Keep README.md at repo root concise; deep details belong here.

See INDEX.md for the authoritative navigation.
