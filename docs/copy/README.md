Copy Directory
==============

Holds canonical marketing/product copy excerpts currently referenced by live site components.

Guidelines:

1. Keep each major page or funnel in its own file (e.g., homepage.md, about.md, services.md).
2. When updating copy in the codebase, reflect the canonical source here (or vice versa) in the same PR.
3. Large historical drafts move to archive/ once distilled.

Pending migrations: legacy full website copy drafts (will keep one canonical snapshot).
