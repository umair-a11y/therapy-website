status: historical-reference
reason: Point-in-time blueprint comparison; actionable items migrated into processes & checklists
---

This document is an archived snapshot of the content gap analysis performed against the early website implementation and blueprint. Current authoritative guidance now lives in:

- `docs/processes/content-review-workflow.md` (review & compliance)
- `docs/checklists/systems-checklist.md` (operational + compliance)
- `docs/checklists/deployment-checklist.md` (release readiness)
- Future per-page copy files (in progress)

The prioritized action items have been integrated; remaining content is preserved for historical traceability.

## Executive Summary

Key trust and conversion gaps originally identified:

1. Placeholder team/founder content
2. Inconsistent consultation offer (15 vs 30 minutes)
3. Missing social proof (testimonials â€“ note: requires CRPO-compliant approach)
4. Value proposition dilution vs blueprint

All critical items have corresponding tasks or have been addressed in restructuring.

## High-Impact Priority Matrix (Original)

| Priority | Item | Status (2025-09) | Notes |
|----------|------|------------------|-------|
| Critical | Replace team placeholders | In progress | Founder bio to be formalized in copy extraction phase |
| Critical | Standardize consultation length | Planned | Align offer messaging site-wide |
| High | Update hero messaging | Planned | To be handled with copy decomposition |
| High | Add founder story | Planned | Location: `copy/about.md` (future) |
| High | Implement contact form | In progress | API & validation patterns defined |
| Medium | Restructure services page | Planned | Pending routing consolidation |
| Medium | Add "Who We Help" section | Planned | Persona copy drafting pending |

## Compliance Watch Points

- Testimonials require strict CRPO framing (may remain deferred or omitted)
- Avoid outcome guarantees in revised hero and service messaging
- Ensure credential accuracy in founder bio

## Sunset Rationale

This analysis represented a point-in-time gap list. Maintaining it live would create divergence from canonical process/checklist docs. Archiving prevents duplicate sources of truth while preserving historical decision context.
