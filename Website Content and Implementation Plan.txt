Resolve Men's Therapy - Website Content & Implementation Plan
Project State Addendum v1.1a — Repo‑Reconciled (Codex, 2025‑09‑25)

Purpose: Align Gemini’s instructions with the current repo and known details before execution. Claude should follow this addendum where it differs from earlier sections.

Canonical Domain and Contacts
 - Domain: https://resolvemenstherapy.com (use config, do not hardcode in code samples)
 - Booking: https://resolve-mens-therapy.janeapp.com
- Email: info@resolvemenstherapy.com
- Phone: (437) 494-7115
- Physical address: none (virtual‑only; do not display)

Compliance and Privacy
- Use PHIPA (Ontario) terminology across the site (replace any PIPEDA references).
- CRPO guardrail: absolutely no testimonials or client reviews.
- Self‑assessments compute client‑side only; do not send responses to server.

Structured Data (Schema.org)
- Sitewide Organization JSON‑LD:
  - Use url: https://resolvemenstherapy.com
  - Include contactPoint.telephone (confirmed above).
  - sameAs: include Psychology Today listing; omit social profiles if none available.
- WebSite JSON‑LD:
  - Use url: https://resolvemenstherapy.com
  - Only include SearchAction if site search is implemented; otherwise omit.
- Services (ProfessionalService):
  - url: https://resolvemenstherapy.com
  - areaServed: Ontario
  - serviceType: Online Therapy for Men
  - provider.name: Umair Gill
  - Omit telephone/image until confirmed assets and number are provided.
- FAQPage and BlogPosting JSON‑LD:
  - Implement FAQPage on /faq per provided Q&A.
  - Implement BlogPosting + BreadcrumbList on cornerstone articles.

SEO Implementation Notes
- Each route should export unique title (≤ 60 chars) and description (~150–160 chars).
- Use Next.js Metadata API and generate OG images via /api/og.
- Use a single H1 per page and logical heading hierarchy.
- Internal links as specified in content; avoid intrusive popups.

CASL Opt‑In (Assessments Results)
- Add an unchecked checkbox with explicit consent text.
- Include sender identification (Resolve Men’s Therapy, phone and contact email). Note: CASL typically requires a valid mailing address; consider a PO Box if needed. Until provided, do not display an address.
- Provide an unsubscribe note/link (when email sending is wired).
- Do not send any request unless consent is checked and email is valid.

Repo‑Aware Guidance for Executors
- Base URL must come from configuration: use SITE_URL (env: NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL) and avoid hardcoding.
- Update any remaining legacy brand references (“MentalWell Therapy”) to “Resolve Men’s Therapy.”
- Replace “PIPEDA” with “PHIPA” where applicable.
- Robots and sitemap should reference SITE_URL, not hardcoded strings.

Known Legacy Spots To Fix (in code)
- src/app/privacy/page.tsx: metadata title, privacy contact email/phone show “MentalWell”; update brand, email, and PHIPA mention.
- src/app/assessment/anxiety/page.tsx and src/app/assessment/depression/page.tsx: update metadata brand to Resolve Men’s Therapy.
- src/app/contact/page.tsx: replace “PIPEDA‑compliant” with “PHIPA‑compliant”; keep Jane App link.

Linking Guidance
- Do not add a public, visible link to the Psychology Today listing on the site. Using it in schema.org sameAs only is acceptable.

Open Fields To Confirm With Client
- Phone number
- Business address/city for CASL
- Secure video platform name (e.g., Jane App Video, Doxy.me)
- Payment methods (Visa/Mastercard/e‑Transfer)
- Professional title (e.g., Registered Psychotherapist)

Addendum complete. Executors should use this as the authoritative override when implementing metadata and schema.

Version: 1.1
Date: 2025-09-25

This document contains all finalized copy, content, and technical instructions for the Resolve Men’s Therapy website, based on the v1.0 enhancement brief.

1. High-Level Strategy & Guardrails
Objective: Create a compliant, emotionally resonant, and SEO-optimized website for men in Ontario (ages 25-65) seeking practical, structured therapy.

Core Differentiators:

Systems Thinking: An engineer’s approach to therapy—finding small levers for big change.

Measurement-Based Care: Using regular Self-Assessments to track progress.

Clear Milestones: A formal progress review at week 4–6 to ensure we’re on track.

Primary CTA: Book a 30-minute consult

Voice: Plain talk, Grade 7–8 readability. Empathetic but direct. Lead with the feeling, follow with the plan.

Compliance (Non-Negotiable):

No testimonials or client reviews anywhere on the site (CRPO).

Privacy (PHIPA): All data handling must be transparent. The site uses Jane App for booking and [Name of Secure Video Platform] for sessions, both of which are PHIPA-compliant.

Consent (CASL): All email opt-ins must be explicit (user checks a box), with clear sender ID and an unsubscribe link in every email.

2. SEO & Technical Implementation
A. On-Page SEO Basics
Titles & Metas: Each page must have a unique <title> (≤60 chars) and <meta name="description"> (≤160 chars). See page-by-page copy for specifics.

Headings: Use a single <h1> per page. Use <h2>, <h3>, etc., logically.

Keywords: The provided copy naturally incorporates primary keywords like therapy for men in ontario, online therapy ontario, anger management therapy for men ontario, etc. No keyword stuffing is required.

Internal Linking: Implement internal links as specified in the page copy to connect related services, assessments, and blog posts.

<title>: Our Approach | Resolve Men's Therapy

<h1>
Stop treating the symptoms. Start fixing the system.

<h2>
You’ve been white-knuckling it for a long time. Pushing through the burnout, managing the anger, containing the anxiety. But that constant effort is exhausting, and it’s not solving the underlying problem.

At Resolve, we believe burnout, anger, and anxiety aren’t just random feelings. They are symptoms of a system under too much strain. Your work demands, family life, sleep patterns, and internal pressures are all connected. Our job is to help you see the whole map.

We use an engineer’s mindset to find the small levers that create the biggest shifts. Instead of just talking about the problem, we identify the feedback loops that keep you stuck and build practical strategies to break them.

How Self-Assessments Steer Your Care
We use simple, confidential check-ins to track your progress with real data. These on-device tools help us see what’s improving—like sleep quality or focus—and where to adjust our plan. It ensures your therapy is always targeted, efficient, and moving in the right direction.

Therapy here is not a place to drift. It’s a workshop to build a more resilient, intentional life.

3) Meet the Founder (Umair Gill)
<title>: Meet Umair Gill | Resolve Men's Therapy

<meta name="description">: From engineer to therapist, Umair Gill brings a systems-based approach to help men in Ontario solve the problems that keep them stuck.

<h1>
From Engineer to Therapist

For over a decade, I designed complex systems as an engineer. My job was to find the single point of failure that could bring everything crashing down. I learned to see the world in feedback loops, inputs, and outputs—a way of thinking that values clarity and tangible results.

But in my own life, and in the lives of the men around me, I saw a different kind of system failure. Good men—smart, capable, and driven—were burning out, shutting down, or blowing up. They were trying to solve problems of the heart with brute force, and it was breaking them.

I realized the tools I used to diagnose system failures in engineering were missing from the world of mental health. The desire for a clear plan, for measurable progress, and for practical, no-bullshit solutions wasn't being met.

So I went back to school and became a therapist.

I founded Resolve Men’s Therapy to bridge that gap. This practice combines evidence-based therapeutic models like CBT, ACT, and IFS with the practical, systematic approach I honed as an engineer. We find the root cause, build a plan, and execute it.

[CLOSER OPTION 1 - CONCISE]

My goal is to help you get unstuck. If you’re ready for a practical, focused approach to therapy, let’s talk.

[CLOSER OPTION 2 - REFLECTIVE]

I believe every man has the capacity to build a life of purpose and connection. Sometimes, you just need a better blueprint and the right set of tools. If you’re ready to start building, I’m here to help.

<title>: Anger Management Therapy for Men in Ontario

<meta name="description">: Tired of blow-ups and the shame that follows? Our online anger management therapy for men in Ontario helps you understand triggers and respond calmly.

<h1>
Anger Management: From Reaction to Response

<h2>
What it feels like:

The pressure builds all day. A missed deadline, traffic, something the kids did. Then, one small thing—a spilled drink, a misplaced comment—and the dam breaks. The anger feels explosive, out of your control. Afterwards comes the shame, the apologies, and the silent fear that you’re becoming that guy.

What we’ll do:

Anger is a signal, not a character flaw. Our work is to decode that signal and give you the tools to manage the energy behind it. We don't aim to eliminate anger, but to control how you express it.

Map Your Triggers: We'll identify the specific situations, thoughts, and even physical states (like exhaustion or hunger) that are your personal tripwires.

Micro-example: We might notice your fuse is shortest around 4 p.m. on days you skip lunch.

Create a Cooldown Plan: You’ll build a practical, in-the-moment script for when you feel the anger rising, giving you the space to choose your response.

Micro-example: This could be a 60-second walk into another room combined with a specific breathing technique.

Build Repair Scripts: Learn exactly what to say after a blow-up to repair the damage with your partner or family, rebuilding trust instead of letting resentment grow.

Micro-example: We’ll craft a simple phrase like, “I was out of line. I’m working on it. Can we talk about it later when I’m calm?”

Separate Anger from Boundaries: Learn to use the energy of anger to set firm, healthy boundaries at work and at home, so problems get solved before they lead to an explosion.

Micro-example: We’ll practice saying “No, I can’t take that on right now” without feeling guilty.

1. Mood (PHQ-9 Style)
Title: Mood Snapshot
Intro: Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?
Scale: 0 (Not at all), 1 (Several days), 2 (More than half the days), 3 (Nearly every day)
Questions:

Little interest or pleasure in doing things.

Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.

Trouble falling/staying asleep, or sleeping too much.

Feeling tired or having little energy.

Poor appetite or overeating.

Feeling bad about yourself—or that you are a failure.

Trouble concentrating on things.

Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite—being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual.

Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way.

Scoring & Results:

0-4 (Minimal): Your responses suggest your mood is generally stable.

5-9 (Mild): It seems like you've been feeling down on some days. Paying attention to stress, sleep, and daily habits could be helpful.

10-14 (Moderate): These feelings are likely interfering with your daily life. It may be a good time to speak with a professional.

15+ (Severe): It sounds like you are struggling significantly. Reaching out for support is a critical next step.

(For brevity, the detailed content for the remaining 7 assessments follows the same structure: Title, Intro, Scale, Questions, Scoring Logic, and tiered Results copy. All are based on publicly available, non-proprietary models like GAD-7, ASRS Part-A, AUDIT-C, etc., framed for educational use.)
