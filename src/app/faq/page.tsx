  {
    question: "What are your fees?",
    answer: "Our session fee is $160 for a 50-minute virtual session. We provide a receipt that you can use for reimbursement from most extended health benefits plans."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer direct billing?",
    answer: "We do not offer direct billing at this time. You can submit your receipt to your insurance provider for reimbursement according to your plan's coverage for Registered Psychotherapists."
  },
  {
    question: "What technology do you use for sessions?",
    answer: "We use a secure, PHIPA-compliant video platform designed for healthcare. You will receive a private link before each session."
  },
  {
    question: "Is online therapy as effective as in-person?",
    answer: "For many issues, research shows that online therapy is just as effective as traditional in-person therapy. It offers the same expert support with added convenience and accessibility from anywhere in Ontario."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if we're a good fit?",
    answer: "The free 30-minute consult is for exactly that. It's a chance for you to ask questions, share what's on your mind, and get a feel for my approach. There is no pressure to continue if it doesn't feel right."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm in crisis?",
    answer: "This practice is not equipped for crisis support. If you are in immediate distress or having thoughts of harming yourself, please contact 9-8-8 (call or text) or go to your nearest emergency room. For non-urgent mental health support, you can contact ConnexOntario at 1-866-531-2600."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my insurance plan cover services from a Registered Psychotherapist?",
    answer: "Therapy with a Registered Psychotherapist is covered by many, but not all, extended health benefits plans in Ontario. We recommend you ask your insurance provider if your plan covers services from a 'Registered Psychotherapist' or 'RP'."
  },
  {
    question: "What is my total coverage amount per year for mental health services?",
    answer: "Coverage amounts vary by plan. Check with your insurance provider about your specific annual limits for mental health services or psychotherapy."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a per-session maximum that my plan will reimburse?",
    answer: "Many plans have per-session maximums. Contact your insurance provider to confirm if there are limits on what they'll reimburse per session."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a doctor's referral to be covered?",
    answer: "Some insurance plans require a doctor's referral for coverage. Check with your provider about whether a referral is needed for your specific plan."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer: "Please provide at least 24 hours' notice to avoid being charged for the session. Life happens, and we understand that sometimes you need to reschedule."
  },
  {
    question: "How long are sessions?",
    answer: "Individual therapy sessions are 50 minutes long. The initial consultation is 30 minutes and free of charge."
