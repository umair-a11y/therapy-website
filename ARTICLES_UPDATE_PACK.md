#### Story Section
**The Moment It All Goes Wrong**

"It's Tuesday evening. You've had back-to-back meetings, skipped lunch, and traffic was brutal. You walk in the door, and your kid's backpack is in the hallwayâ€”again.

Something snaps. You're yelling before you even realize it. The look on their face tells you you've gone too far. Again. The guilt hits immediately, but the damage is done.

Sound familiar? You're not alone, and you're not broken. Your system is overwhelmed."

#### Systems View Section
**H2**: "The Low-Resource State: Why You Explode"

"Think of your emotional regulation like a phone battery. Every stressor drains it:
- Poor sleep? -20%
- Skipped meals? -15%
- Work pressure? -30%
- Traffic? -10%

By evening, you're running on 5%. Any small trigger causes a system crashâ€”explosive anger is your brain's emergency response when resources are depleted.

**The Feedback Loop:**
1. Stress accumulates â†’ Resources deplete
2. Resources low â†’ Hair-trigger responses
3. Explosive anger â†’ Relationship damage
4. Guilt and shame â†’ More stress
5. Repeat

This isn't a character flaw. It's a system problem that needs a system solution."

#### 3-Step Practice Section
**H2**: "Your 3-Step Anger Intervention Plan"

**Step 1: Identify Your Physical Warning Signs**
"Your body signals incoming anger 60-90 seconds before explosion:
- Jaw clenching
- Chest tightening
- Heat rising in face
- Hands forming fists

**Action**: This week, track your physical signs in a notes app. Just awareness changes the game."

**Step 2: Implement the Strategic Pause**
"When you feel the warning signs:
- Say: 'I need a minute'
- Leave the room
- Count 90 seconds (anger's peak duration)
- Ask yourself: 'What do I actually need right now?'

**Action**: Practice this even when not angry. Make it automatic."

**Step 3: Master One Repair Script**
"After cooling down, use this template:
'I was out of line. My reaction was about my stress, not about you. I'm working on handling things better. Can we talk about what happened?'

**Action**: Write your version. Keep it in your phone. Use it."

### Metadata Export
```typescript
export const metadata = {
  title: "How to Shut Down the 2 a.m. Worry Machine | Resolve",
  description: "Understand the cortisol-driven 'unsolved problem loop' that keeps you awake. Learn practical techniques to quiet your racing mind and get back to sleep.",
};
```

### Article Structure

#### Header
- **H1**: "How to Shut Down the 2 a.m. Worry Machine"
- **Subtitle**: "Why your brain won't stop at nightâ€”and what actually works to quiet it."
- **Category**: "Anxiety & Sleep"
- **Read Time**: "7 min read"

#### Story Section
**When Your Brain Won't Stop**

"It's 2:47 a.m. You've been awake for an hour, mind racing through tomorrow's presentation, last week's argument, next month's bills. You try to force sleep, but that makes it worse.

Your partner sleeps peacefully beside you. You feel alone with your spinning thoughts, angry at your brain for betraying you when you need rest most.

This isn't insomnia. It's your brain's misguided attempt to solve problems when it should be resting."

#### Systems View Section
**H2**: "The Unsolved Problem Loop"

"At night, your prefrontal cortex (logic center) is tired, but your amygdala (alarm system) stays active. This creates the perfect storm:

**The Cortisol Cascade:**
1. Worry triggers cortisol release
2. Cortisol increases alertness
3. Alertness prevents sleep
4. Lack of sleep impairs problem-solving
5. Unsolved problems create more worry

Your tired brain can identify problems but can't solve them effectively. It's like trying to do calculus after three beersâ€”frustrating and futile.

**The 2 a.m. Truth**: Your brain literally cannot solve complex problems effectively when sleep-deprived. Any 'solution' you find at 2 a.m. will seem ridiculous at 8 a.m."

#### 3-Step Practice Section
**H2**: "Your 3-Step Sleep Recovery Protocol"

**Step 1: The Worry Write-Down**
"Keep a notebook by your bed. When worries hit:
- Write each worry as one sentence
- Add: 'I will address this at [specific time tomorrow]'
- Close the notebook

This tells your brain: message received, action scheduled, you can stop now.

**Action**: Put a notebook and pen by your bed tonight."

**Step 2: The 5-Minute Breathing Reset**
"If still awake after write-down:
- Breathe in for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Out for 6 counts
- Hold empty for 2 counts
- Repeat for 5 minutes

This activates your parasympathetic nervous system, countering cortisol.

**Action**: Practice this during the day first. Make it familiar."

**Step 3: The Midnight Rule**
"No problem-solving after midnight. Period.
If your brain insists on working:
- Acknowledge: 'This feels urgent but isn't'
- Remind: 'Tired brains make bad decisions'
- Redirect: Return to breathing

**Action**: Write this rule somewhere visible."

#### Story Section
**Flying Blind vs. Flying Smart**

"Imagine two pilots flying through clouds. One relies on feeling: 'I think we're level, feels like we're heading north.' The other checks instruments: 'Altitude 30,000, heading 015, on course.'

Which pilot would you trust with your life?

Yet most therapy operates like the first pilotâ€”relying on feeling over data. 'How was your week?' becomes the only measure of progress. We think there's a better way."

#### Systems View Section
**H2**: "Measurement-Based Care: The Science"

"The American Psychological Association's research is clear: measurement-based care improves outcomes by up to 50%. Why?

**Data Reveals Truth:**
- Memory is unreliable (you forget the good days during bad weeks)
- Progress is often subtle (10% better doesn't feel different, but it matters)
- Patterns emerge over time (Tuesday anxiety spikes you never noticed)

**Our Measurement System:**
1. **Baseline**: Where you start (PHQ-9, GAD-7, custom assessments)
2. **Regular Checks**: Brief weekly or biweekly measures
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying triggers and improvements
4. **Course Correction**: Adjusting treatment based on data

This isn't about reducing you to numbers. It's about ensuring your investment in therapy pays off."

#### Practice Section
**H2**: "Try It Yourself"

"Experience measurement-based care firsthand:

1. **Take a Baseline**: Try our [Mood Snapshot](/self-check/depression) or [Anxiety Check](/self-check/anxiety)
2. **Track for Two Weeks**: Retake the same assessment weekly
3. **Spot Patterns**: Notice what you learn about yourself

Most men are surprised by what data revealsâ€”both the hidden struggles and the overlooked progress.

**The 4-6 Week Review**: In our practice, we formally review your data at weeks 4-6. No guessing if therapy is workingâ€”we'll know."

   - Explain the why behind the what
   - Break down the feedback loops
   - Normalize the struggle (system problem, not character flaw)
