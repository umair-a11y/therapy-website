# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY RULES - NEVER VIOLATE
- **NEVER expose API keys, secrets, or credentials in code or comments**
- **NEVER commit sensitive data like `.env` files, private keys, or passwords**  
- **NEVER disable security features without explicit approval**
- **ALWAYS validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks**
- **ALWAYS use HTTPS for production endpoints and secure authentication**

## üèóÔ∏è CORE ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### Development Philosophy
- **Code Quality**: Prioritize readability, maintainability, and performance
- **Testing**: Write tests first (TDD) - unit, integration, and e2e coverage
- **Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting with minimal but meaningful comments
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimize for both developer experience and runtime efficiency

## üîç LARGE CODEBASE ANALYSIS

### When Context Limits Are Exceeded
Use Gemini CLI for comprehensive codebase analysis with its massive context window:

```bash
# Full project analysis
gemini -p "@./ Analyze the overall architecture and suggest improvements"
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

# Single file analysis
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

# Multiple files comparison
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

# Entire directory analysis
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

# Multiple directories
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"
```

### Implementation Verification Examples
Use Gemini CLI to verify if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented:

```bash
# Feature existence checking
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

# Authentication verification
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

# Security pattern validation
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

# Error handling verification
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

# Caching strategy analysis
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

# Rate limiting check
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

# Test coverage verification
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"

# Pattern detection
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"
```

### When to Use Gemini CLI
Use `gemini -p` when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files (100KB+ total)
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase
- Working with files that would overflow Claude's context window

### Gemini CLI Usage Patterns
- **Architecture Review**: `@src/ @lib/ @components/` for structural analysis
- **Security Audit**: `@api/ @middleware/ @auth/` for security verification
- **Performance Check**: `@services/ @utils/ @database/` for optimization opportunities
- **Documentation Gap**: `@docs/ @README.md @src/` for documentation completeness
- **Feature Verification**: `@src/ @lib/` for checking implementation status
- **Test Analysis**: `@src/ @tests/` for coverage and quality assessment

### Important Technical Notes
- **Path Relativity**: All `@` paths are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- **Context Capacity**: Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- **Read-Only Analysis**: No need for `--yolo` flag for read-only analysis tasks
- **File Inclusion**: The CLI includes file contents directly in the context for analysis

## üêõ DEBUGGING AND TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Debug Strategies
1. **Reproduce the Issue**: Create minimal reproducible examples
2. **Check Logs**: Review application and error logs systematically
3. **Use Debugger**: Step through code execution with breakpoints
4. **Test Isolation**: Isolate components to identify root cause
5. **Documentation**: Update docs with solutions for future reference

### Error Handling Patterns
```javascript
// Frontend error boundaries
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo);
  }
}

// Backend error middleware
const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  const statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
  const message = err.message || 'Internal Server Error';
  
  logger.error('Error:', { error: err, request: req });
  
  res.status(statusCode).json({
    error: {
      message,
      ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && { stack: err.stack })
    }
  });
};
```

3. **Chunk Execution**: Implement focused changes (3-5 files max)
4. **Gemini Review**: Validate quality, security, compliance
5. **Iterate**: Move to next chunk or refine current approach

```bash
# Example Chunk Workflow
# Step 1: Planning
gemini -p "@src/components/ Plan refactoring of navigation components. Break into executable chunks"

# Step 2: Pre-Chunk Review
gemini -p "@src/components/Header.tsx I'm about to refactor this component. Review and flag issues"

# Step 3: Execute chunk (modify 2-3 related files)

# Step 4: Post-Chunk Review
gemini -p "@src/components/Header.tsx @src/components/Navigation.tsx Review my changes. Verify improvements and catch issues"

# Step 5: Progress Documentation
gemini -p "@./ Document progress on navigation refactoring. Next steps and remaining chunks"
```
